Simulate the recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model to make a temporal analysis of the {"meta":"model_name"} model by analysing the most recent item in user's movie viewing history from candidate set. The recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model is:{"soft":None,"duplicate":100}. The candidate set is:{"meta":"user_can"}. The user has already watched {"meta":"ICL"}, [movie M]. Then, The next movie the user plan to watch is {"meta":"m_1"}. The most recent item [movie M] in user's movie viewing history is {"meta":"m"}. After that, the user has also watched {"meta":"user_TA"}, [movie X]. Then, The next movie the user plan to watch is {"meta":"next"}. The most recent item [movie X] in user's movie viewing history is {mask}.
Simulate the recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model to make a temporal analysis of the {"meta":"model_name"} model by analysing the most recent item in user's item purchasing history from candidate set. The recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model is:{"soft":None,"duplicate":100}. The candidate set is:{"meta":"user_can"}. The user has already purchased {"meta":"ICL"}, [item M]. Then, The next item the user plan to purchase is {"meta":"m_1"}. The most recent item [item M] in user's item purchasing history is {"meta":"m"}. After that, the user has also purchased {"meta":"user_TA"}, [item X]. Then, The next item the user plan to purchase is {"meta":"next"}. The most recent item [item X] in user's item purchasing history is {mask}.
Simulate the recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model to make a temporal analysis of the {"meta":"model_name"} model by analysing the most recent item in user's game playing history from candidate set. The recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model is:{"soft":None,"duplicate":100}. The candidate set is:{"meta":"user_can"}. The user has already played {"meta":"ICL"}, [game M]. Then, The next game the user plan to play is {"meta":"m_1"}. The most recent item [game M] in user's game playing history is {"meta":"m"}.
