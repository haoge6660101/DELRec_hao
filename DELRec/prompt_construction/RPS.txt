Simulate the recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model to predict next movies that the user might watch from candidate set based on user's movie viewing history. The recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model is:{"soft":None,"duplicate":100}. The movie viewing history of the user is:{"meta":"user_seq"}. The candidate set is:{"meta":"user_can"}. Next movies the user will watch (predicted by the {"meta":"model_name"} model) might be:{"mask"},{"meta":"SR_pre"}.
Simulate the recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model to predict next items that the user might purchase from candidate set based on user's item purchasing history. The recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model is:{"soft":None,"duplicate":100}. The item purchasing history of the user is:{"meta":"user_seq"}. The candidate set is:{"meta":"user_can"}. Next items the user will purchase (predicted by the {"meta":"model_name"} model) might be:{"mask"},{"meta":"SR_pre"}.
Simulate the recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model to predict next games that the user might play from candidate set based on user's game playing history. The recommendation pattern of the {"meta":"model_name"} model is:{"soft":None,"duplicate":100}. The game playing history of the user is:{"meta":"user_seq"}. The candidate set is:{"meta":"user_can"}. Next games the user will play (predicted by the {"meta":"model_name"} model) might be:{"mask"},{"meta":"SR_pre"}.
